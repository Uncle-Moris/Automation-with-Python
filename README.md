## Project Description

**FlaskReactDeploy** is a demonstration project integrating a web application built with Flask (backend) and React (frontend) using modern DevOps tools. The project showcases a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline for both server and client applications, featuring automated testing, Docker image building, and deployment to AWS (ECR and ECS).

### Key Features

- **Backend (Flask):** A RESTful API server built with the Flask framework, handling basic CRUD operations.
- **Frontend (React):** A user interface created with React that communicates with the backend via API.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** A fully automated CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions, including unit testing, Docker image building, and deployment to AWS.
- **Unit Testing:** Implementation of unit tests for both applications, using `pytest` (for Flask) and `Jest` (for React).
